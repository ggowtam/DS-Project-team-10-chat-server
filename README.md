Close( ):  Closes the socket connection and stream i/p , o/p.
//method done by Sharanya
writeMsg( ) : A string message is sent if the client is still connected.

as localhost and port.

Methods:
Start( ): The start method uses socket connection with parameters server and port 
to establish a server connection , if it fails catch block handles the exception 
and displays Error message and a message connection accepted if its 
established successfully. It also creates a two way data stream to input and 
output data from server. ListenFromServer creates a thread and start() is used to 
type our username to join.
//method done by Yoshita

sendMessage( ) : Sends message to server using stream output object.
//method done by Gowtam

Disconnect( ): Close the input and output streams.
//method done by Yoshita
The client main method uses infinite loop to get input from user and executes
 the message type LEAVE, SHUTDOWN, SHUTDOWNALL depending on 
the user input.
The class ListenFromServer extends thread class and runs method run() to read
 the input message from server.
//method done by Sharanya, Yoshita, Gowtam

ChatMessage:
